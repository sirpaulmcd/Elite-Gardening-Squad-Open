# Onion Trail

Onion Trail is a cooperative party revamp of the classic game [Oregon Trail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Oregon_Trail_(1985_video_game)) similar in nature to [Death Road to Canada](https://store.steampowered.com/app/252610/Death_Road_to_Canada/).
The game is currently being developed in C# using the Unity game engine. 
We are unable to post the entire Unity project due to the assets used in game. However, all scripts are open source. 
Progress is made via agile development by a small team in their spare time. For more info, check out the [project wiki](https://github.com/sirpaulmcd/Elite-Gardening-Squad-Open/wiki).
