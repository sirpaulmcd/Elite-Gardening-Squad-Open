# Elite-Gardening-Squad-Open
Elite Gardening Squad is a proof-of-concept, couch co-op, dungeon crawler game about gardening.
The game is currently being developed in C# using the Unity game engine. 
We are unable to post the entire Unity project due to the assets used in game. However, all scripts are open source. 
Progress is made via agile development by a small team in their spare time. For more info, check out the [project wiki](https://github.com/sirpaulmcd/Elite-Gardening-Squad-Open/wiki).
