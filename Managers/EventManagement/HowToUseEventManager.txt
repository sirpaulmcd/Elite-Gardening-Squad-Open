To implement a new event into the EventManager, you must:
    1 - Add event name to EventName enum (held within EventName.cs)
    2 - Create the Event and EventArgs class (see SpacePressedEvent.cs example)
    3 - Setup event invoker (see Producer.cs example)
    4 - Setup event listener (see Consumer.cs example) 

The easiest way to learn how the EventManager works is to study the example.
The example prints the number of times the space bar has been printed to the console.
Producer.cs invokes a SpacePressedEvent when the space bar is pressed.
Consumer.cs prints "Pressed space X times" whenever an SpacePressedEvent is invoked.

To test the example code within a scene, simply add the Producer.cs and Consumer.cs
components to a GameObject in the scene.
