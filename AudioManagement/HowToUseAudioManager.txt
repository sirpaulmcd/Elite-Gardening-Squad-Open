How to add audio and use it inside your scripts:
1. Add audiofile (preferably WAV) to Resource/Audio folder
2. Add Enumeration name to AudioClipName.cs within Scripts/AudioManagement/
3. Modify AudioManager.cs within Scripts/AudioManagement/ to include a new 
resource load in the InitAudioClips method. You will have to include your AudioClipName 
and the clip to load (filename of audiofile).
4. Simply call AudioManager.Play(AudioClipName.<yourAudioClipName>, <Volumeasafloat>) 
method within your script. See Health.cs for an example.
